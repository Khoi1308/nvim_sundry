What is Mason? Mason is package manager for nvim 
- so we have lazy.nvim which we use as a plugin manager, it installs and manages all our different plugins that we are using with nvim 
- Mason is a package manager, it actually manages packages that we might need in our enviroment, so anything that is a third-party application that lies besides Neo as kind of a side car which is running there, like for example: formats, linters, or LSP servers or to speak so language servers. And Mason will take care of knowing where to find them, how to update them, how to install them, and make them available to nvim. So that's what we are using Mason for

- LSP stands for Language Server Protocol and it's open Json RPC based protocol for use between source code editors and server that provide programming language specific features. Essentially, the LSP is a background task running on your machine, waiting to give you functionality based on what you're asking for interestingly enough LSP was originally developed by Microsoft for visual studio code, it made later made in open source standard with Microsoft, Red hat, CodeEnvy all having a hand. Personally, I find it really interesting that the creation of Vscode ushered in this era of amazing tooling for vim through LSP
