- Mason is a package manager, it actually manages packages that we might need in our enviroment, so anything that is a third-party application that lies besides Neo as kind of a side car which is running there, like for example: formats, linters, or LSP servers or to speak so language servers. And Mason will take care of knowing where to find them, how to update them, how to install them, and make them available to nvim. So that's what we are using Mason for
