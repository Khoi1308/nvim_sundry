- Today we will talk about Language Server Protocols (LSPs). What is the LSP? LSP actually is something quite interesting that has been around for almost a decade by now.
- LSP actually is a Json RPC based protocol for using source code editors and integrated development enviroments to provide language intelligence tools. So what that means is actually language servers allow us to split off the part that until a couple years ago has been strictly integrated into a certain IDE at times into a seperate server for each of the languages, therefore allowing any IDE and any editor, and this includes nvim of course to access all of this intelligence tools. What does that mean? It means something like understanding the language knowing which symbols are in it, what is variable, what is function like navigating around, jumping around like jump to a specific declaration, jump to an implementation of something.
- Providing us with proper information like linting information, compile errors, or all kind of warnings and stuff that we need to further interact with our code
- Providing us with refactoring tools simple stuff like renaming a symbol or even extracting some somthing into a method or anything else you can think of that makes an IDE. That's actually kind of done within language servers today. And nvim supports language servers, it's supports language servers first of all as a basic feature within its core implementation
